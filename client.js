// Write your code here!

// 1. Start with the number 29 and set that equal to a variable named ‘highScore’;

// 2. Make a new empty array called myScrabbleTiles.

// 3. Put these 6 tile objects into myScrabbleTiles:
/*
  { tile: 'N', score: 1 }
  { tile: 'K', score: 5 }
  { tile: 'Z', score: 10 }
  { tile: 'X', score: 8 }
  { tile: 'D', score: 2 }
  { tile: 'A', score: 1 }
*/

// 4. Remove the last tile from myScrabbleTiles.


// 5. Add the following new tile to myScrabbleTiles:
/*
  { tile: 'F', score : 4 }
*/

// 6. Complete this function. It needs to be given an array of tile objects. The function will use a for-loop and return the sum of all the scores in the given array.
function sumTiles(anArray) {

}


// 7. Use the function above to get the total score for myScrabbleTiles and assign the value to a variable called "myScore".


// 8. Check whether or not your score is higher than the highScore.
// 8-1 If your score is higher, change highScore to the new high score.


// DONE!
